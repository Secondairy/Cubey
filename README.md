Cubey is love, Cubey is life.

Have you ever wanted to speedrun, with 100% guatantee of getting a treasure bastion? Well, here it is - the mod for you.

As an added bonus, all the magma cube spawners are blaze spawners. Could make for some sick routes and task overlaps.

As an extra extra bonus, fortresses have been completely removed.
